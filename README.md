# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab: Verbum Reprehendo

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice implemention of more advanced data structures and algorithms from scratch. **Verbum Reprehendo**, a spell checker for the most common English words, takes advantage of trie, a digital tree data structure, and Damerau-Levehnstein distance in its implementation.

**Verbum Reprehendo** is a simple command line spell checker, where the user can input a sentence, and the application indicates which words are correctly written. For the misspelled ones, the application suggests alternative correctly written words.
