# Weekly report: Week 2

## Actions taken during this week

During this week (week 2) I target to...
* First make an implementation of the generation of words based on Damerau-Levenhstein (one distance) with Wagner-Fischer algorithm for one word
* Then I will try to make the operations for the trie data structure, testing the structure
* If time allows, I will start cleaning up the WordNet data, so that words can be added to the application's dictionary

Other tasks during this week include:
* Start documenting the program in the user guide (Python Docstrings and instruction for opening and running the app)
* Start testing for the methods and classes done (unittest)
* Show test status in the Git project (codecov)
* Configure style checker (Pylint, autopep8)
* Update weekly report (Started)
