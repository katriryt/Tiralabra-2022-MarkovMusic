# Implementation document

## Project structure

Overall program structure with high level architectural pictures to be added. 

## Implemented time and space complexities

Time and space complexities (e.g. big-O analysis of pseudo code) to be added.

Please note that as the project is not focused on applications' performance, comparative performance and complexity analysis are not done.

## Possible flaws and improvements

Possible flaws and ideas for improvements and further development areas to be added.

## Sources

Multiple sources of data, articles to understand the different algorithms, and examples for implementation of the algorithms have been used. Please find the most relevant below.

### Data

Baseline for the **English language words** used in the application is provided by Princeton University's [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/), which consists of ~150,000 commonly used English words. This application is developed complying with the [WordNet 3.0 license](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/license-and-commercial-use) that maintains the copyright with the Princeton University. Please see the copyright text below. 

Frequencies for the words used in the application are based on analysis of texts in the [British National Corpus XML Edition](https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2554), downloaded from the Oxford Text Archive. (Source: BNC Consortium, 2007, British National Corpus, XML edition, Oxford Text Archive, http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12024/2554.) Use of this database is restricted and licensed under [BNC User Licence](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/licence.html). As a result, no data directly from the database is shared here; only frequencies calculated based on the texts are used in this application. Similar analysis of data is available at [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists). BNC containts texts with ~100,000,000 words from both written and spoken English from the beginning of the 1990s.

In total, this application's dictionary consists of Â¨150,000 words. ~57,000 of these words have frequency data available; for the rest the frequency is assumed to be 1. When the full dictionary is limited only to words consisting of characters in the English alphabet, the application handles ~77,000 words on a continuous basis.

Sources for misspelled English words used in the automated tests to be added.

### Distance metrics

Approach for calculating the distance metrics follows [Damerau (1964)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/363958.363994). There are a few minor differences, though. For example, while Damerau(1964) limits the spellchecking to words longer than 3 characters, and checks only high occurrency words from the dictionary for words with 4-6 characters, no such limitations are needed here, as computer's calculation power is nowadays higher. 

In the implementation, multiple sources have been studied. The most important have been: [Wikipedia: Damerau-Levenhstein distance (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)), [Wikipedia: Wagner-Fischer algorithm article (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm)), [Wikipedia: Levenshtein distance (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), and examples of distance metrics calculation and implementation from [Jensen (2022)](https://www.lemoda.net/text-fuzzy/damerau-levenshtein/index.html), [Grashchenko (2021)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/levenshtein-distance-computation), and [Norvig (2016)](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).

In the keyboard heuristics, QWERTY US keyboard is used as the baseline keyboard, because QWERTY is the most widespread layout in use (source: [Wikipedia: QWERTY, (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY). US variant is used, because there is no need for regional variants (only English alphabets are allowed in the application). Examples to consider keyboard distances was provided by [Burton, 2002](https://metacpan.org/pod/String::KeyboardDistance).
